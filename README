This is a very simple plotting utility library which uses SDL and OpenGL.

Right now, you can plot a function y of x to a window. Eventually there will
be image saving as well, along with many other classes of functions. It's
really just a quick dirty hack at the moment I banged out in an hour waiting
for class.

Compiling:
	make

Running:
	./plot-test

Note: This isn't set up to be compiled as a separate library yet. Still need
to work on that.

Usage:
	For now, all you can really do is take a gander at plot.h and plot-test.c
	and do similar things in your own code. Or go google an actual library
	instead of this ;) If you do use this, I assume you can work a Makefile.
